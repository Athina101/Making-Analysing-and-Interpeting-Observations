**Title:** Interannual variability of the North Atlantic Ocean sea level anomalies from Altimeter Observations

**Abstract:**
<p align="justify">
In this study we investigate the North Atlantic Ocean Circulation using sea level anomaly altimeter observations. From Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) decomposition we find the first mode representing around 6% of the data. The EOF1 illustrates the characteristic dipole pattern of this region with positive sea level anomalies in the suptropical gyre and negative sea level anomalies in the supbolar gyre. Following Kaiser’s rule we use the first 86 EOF’s that explain around 78% of the variance, to reconstruct the data. Furthermore, from correlation analysis we find highest positive correlation between our data and the annual Florida current (r = 0.88), and our data and the North Atlantic Oscillation in winter (r = 0.71). We find the two highest negative correlations between our data and the annual Atlantic Meridional Mode (r = -0.76), and our data and the annual Tropical North Atlantic index (r = -0.68).
